Basic program for binding controls quickly in Wonderful World and other games with bad controller support at offline events.

You can specify a configuration file with -f \<PATH\> to change what game it is binding controls for, or else it will load bindings.json in its own directory (and if there is none, it will load the configuration for Wonderful World).

Currently for bindings using the numpad and likely some other buttons, Windows and Linux need to use different configuration files. This will hopefully be fixed soon.

Current configuration files in the repo:
- 2D Fighter Maker 2nd (Generic Bindings)
- 2D Fighter Maker 95 (Generic Bindings)
- Comic Party Wars 2
- Touhou 3: Phantasmagoria of Dim. Dream
- Wonderful World

Let me know if there are any you want added (or made your own and want them on the repo) or issues you have discovered.

More features coming soonâ„¢.
